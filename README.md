![SBB's API Principles](images/API-Principles-Logo.jpg)

This is the repository for maintaining the SBB's API Principles, as part of the company wide *Integration Architecture* initiative. The principles are subject to constant improvements and are valid for all kind of software projects, independent of the chosen procurement model: reuse, buy, customize, make and also shoring.

## Repository Structure

#### Documentation
The [/docs](/docs) folder contains all the markdown files which are rendered with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The master branch is automatically being published using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). For styling, we use [Patrick Marceill](https://github.com/pmarsceill)'s awesome jekyll theme called *[Just-The-Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs)*.

#### Styling
Custom styling is overwritten in the [_sass/custom](/_sass/custom) Folder. For further information on customization, read the documentation for [customization](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/customization/).
